This folder has 5 scripts:
1. Actor.py: It returns the best action or a policy that refers to a probability distribution over actions.
2. Critic.py: The critic evaluates the actions returned by the actor-network.
3. Agent.py: Train an agent to perform reinforcement learning based on the actor and critic networks
4. Helper.py: Create functions like formating the stock price and get a state vector that will be helpful for training,
5. Training.py: Train the data, based on our agent and helper methods.
